<h1>Layout</h1>
<p>Layout is the process of determining the locations of figures in a drawing. 
This two step process includes marking figures as invalid (needing layout), and 
then validating the &quot;branches&quot; of figures that are invalid. Multiple updates to 
a drawing can result in multiple figures becoming invalid. To prevent 
intermediate states from being displayed to the user, Draw2d provides a deferred 
update strategy which integrates layout with native paint requests as well as 
figures requesting repaints.&nbsp; The result is that layouts occur all at once, 
after which the results are painted.</p>
<p>Figure delegates the task of placing children to their 
<code>LayoutManager</code>. This allows layouts to be swapped and is also just 
good separation of concerns. Layouts cannot be shared because they may cache 
information about their owner.</p>
<h3>Validation</h3>
<p>Validation is almost synonymous with layout. A figure that needs to layout is 
marked as <i>invalid<b>.</b></i> All figures start in the invalid state when 
constructed.&nbsp; At some point later when <code>validate()</code> 
is called, they mark themselves as valid and perform their layout. After layout, 
the figure will then validate its children. Draw2d only uses validate to perform 
layouts, but in theory it could be extended to perform any sort of potentially 
expensive calculation that needs to be integrated with the update manager.</p>
<h3>Preferred Size</h3>
<p>Most layouts need to query the children for their size constraints. IFigure 
provides methods for querying the minimum, preferred, and maximum sizes. A 
figure such as Label will have a preferred size based on its text or icon being 
displayed. If a figure contains other figures, then its preferred size will be 
based on how it would like to arrange its children. In this case, the size 
requests are forwarded to the layout manager.</p>
<p>Hints can be used when querying preferred and minimum size. For example, if 
the amount of available width is known, this width can be passed to a figure 
which may be wrapping a paragraph of text. The figure would then return the 
height and width necessary to wrap the paragraph to the given amount of space.</p>
<h3>Changes that cause Layouts</h3>
<p>When a figure is changed in a way that affects its preferred size or layout, 
it calls <code>revalidate()</code>. Revalidation is the process of marking 
yourself as invalid and requesting revalidate on your parent figure. This 
process continues up the parent chain until the root figure (or some validation 
root) adds itself to the update managers list of invalid figures. At a later 
time, the update manager will go through its collection of invalid figures and 
call validate() on them. In some situations, invalid figures may be added or 
re-added during validation. This is fine as long as the dependencies do not 
result in a never-ending cycle. The following image shows the chain of events:</p>
<table border="0" id="table1">
	<tr>
		<td width="50%"><img src="images/revalidate.gif"/></td>
		<td width="50%"><img src="images/validate.gif"/></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td width="50%"><i>A changes happens to Fig 4 that affects its preferred 
		size. It calls revalidate(), which walks up the parent chain marking 
		figures as invalid until a &quot;root&quot; is reached which is reported to the 
		update manager.</i></td>
		<td width="50%"><i>The update manager validates the invalid branches. 
		Layout happens top-down. Note the Fig 5 was not invalid, but if Fig 2 
		changes its size as a result of laying out, the Fig 5 will mark itself 
		as invalid and get validated as part of the same pass.</i></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>In the above example, Fig 5 may have its size changed when Fig 2 performs its 
layout. </p>
<h3>Top-Down Layout</h3>
<p>Normally figures layout in a top-down fashion. This means that figure has its 
bounds set before it lays out its children. Also, after it places its children, 
it then calls validate() on them in case their size changed, making them 
invalid. This is the same way that Composites work in SWT.</p>
<h3>Special-Purpose Layout Techniques</h3>
<p>In some cases, the top-down process is modified. A common example is figures 
whose bounds must wrap around the bounds of their children. 
<a href="connections.html">Connections</a and &quot;freeform&quot; figures are examples 
of this behavior. In these cases, the figures still layout children first, but 
they determine their own bounds afterwards. Note that the children are not 
positioned relative to the bounds since it is unknown during layout. This also 
implies that the figures do not use local coordinates for their children.</p>
<p>The other special layout case is found in the text package. Text figures must 
layout in two steps. First, they contribute fragments into paragraphs or blocks. 
These fragments may get reordered for bidirectional text. Also, their baselines 
and the overall alignment of each line may also be adjusted. The end of a line 
or block may only occur after a figure has finished its layout. So, the second 
layout pass is simply a finalization step in which the figures are told to now 
update their bounds based on their final fragment locations. Understanding this 
layout is no necessary for using the text package, but it does help in 
appreciating some of the problems solved by Draw2d's approach to layouts and 
coordinate systems.</p>
