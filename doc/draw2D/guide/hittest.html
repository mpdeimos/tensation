<h1>Hit Testing</h1>
<p>There are several situations which require finding a figure for a mouse 
location. For example, determining which tooltip to display when the mouse 
pauses on top of a figure canvas. Another example is interactive graphical 
applications, which must interpret dragging one figure on top of another.</p>
<p>There are four methods available on IFigure which perform hit testing, three 
of which are actually just convenience methods which call the fourth.</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>
	<a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/draw2d/IFigure.html#findFigureAt(int, int)">
	findFigureAt(int x, int y)</a></code>- finds the top-most figure for the 
	given x and y coordinate</li>
	<li><code><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/draw2d/IFigure.html#findFigureAt(org.eclipse.draw2d.geometry.Point)">
	findFigureAt(Point p)</a></code> - similar to above, except takes a Point 
	instead of an int</li>
	<li><code><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/draw2d/IFigure.html#findFigureAt(int, int, java.util.Collection)">
	findFigureAtExcluding(int x, int y, Collection exclude)</a></code> - finds 
	the top-most figure for the given coordinates that is not in the exclusion 
	set or contained by a figure in the exclusion set. This is used for ignoring 
	a figure being dragged, or for ignoring transparent layers or figures which 
	are not involved in an interaction.</li>
	<li>
	<p><code><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/draw2d/IFigure.html#findFigureAt(int, int, org.eclipse.draw2d.TreeSearch)">
	findFigureAt(int x, int y, TreeSearch)</a></code> - All of the above methods 
	call this method. TreeSearch is a helper that is used to quickly prune 
	branches which should not be searched, and to accept the final candidate 
	figure.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Hit testing must be done exactly the same way as painting. Clipping and 
coordinate changes must be duplicated in both. As an optimizations, branches of 
the figure composition tree are pruned by calling <code>containsPoint()</code>. 
If a figure does not contain the location, it returns NULL and does not search 
its children. By default, all figures are considered to be the rectangular 
region defined by their bounds, regardless of how or if they paint. This can be 
overridden as it is in Polyline, Ellipse, and other figures.</p>
