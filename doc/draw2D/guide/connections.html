   <title>Connections and Routing</title>

<h1>Connections and Routing</h1>
<p>Connections figures are used to display a line between two points. 
The <a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/draw2d/Connection.html"><code>Connection</code></a> interface extends <code>IFigure</code>. The provided <code>PolylineConnection</code>&nbsp; 
implementation can be used in most cases. The source and target endpoints of a 
connection are each defined using a <code>ConnectionAnchor</code>. These 
endpoints, along with any other points on the connection, are set by the 
connection's <code>ConnectionRouter</code>. 
Usually every connection in a drawing has the same router instance. Connections 
with common endpoints can share anchor instances as well.</p>
<h3>Connection Usage</h3>
<p>Connections are created and added just like any other figure. 
Usually, connections should be displayed above other elements of a drawing using 
Layers. Unlike normal figures, you must not set the bounds of a connection. 
Instead, you must provide the source and target anchors and let the 
connection router calculate the connection's points.&nbsp; 
The connection then determines its own bounding box.</p>
<p>A connection has a simple router by default - one that can connect 
the source and target anchors. But additional routers are available and can be 
set on the connection. Some routers can handle constraints for the connection 
such as a list of bendpoints through which the connection passes. Note that when 
setting a routing constraint on a connection, you must first set the router 
which will use that constraint.</p>
<p>A convenient way to share the router with all connections and to 
place connections above the drawing is to 
use a <code>ConnectionLayer</code>. The layer has a connection router property 
which it shares with every child that's a connection. You can update 
this property and easily change every connection's router at once.</p>
<h3>Routing and Anchors</h3>
<p>A connection always has a router and it must set at least two 
points on the connection: the source and target endpoints. By default, or when 
set to <code>null</code>, the connection's routing will be performed by an internal default 
router. The ends are placed with the help of anchors. An anchor is a fixed or 
calculated location, usually associated with some figure. For example, the ChopboxAnchor finds the 
point at which a line going to the reference point intersects a box, such as the 
bounds of a figure. The 
<i>reference point</i> is either the anchor at the opposite end, or a bendpoint or some 
other point nearest to the anchor. Anchors notify the connection when their 
anchor points has changed.</p>

<i>A ChopboxAnchor calculates the connection endpoint by finding the reference's

<p>The router calculates the endpoints and any other points in the 
middle of the connection. It then sets the points on the connection by calling 
<a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/draw2d/Connection.html#setPoints(org.eclipse.draw2d.geometry.PointList)">
<code>setPoints(PointList)</code></a>. The connection's existing point list can be reused to 
reduce garbage, but the points must be set on the connection anyway so that it 
knows about any changes made.</p>
<h3>Adding Decorations and Children to Connections</h3>
<p>Like most figures, PolylineConnection supports the addition of children. The children might be 
arrowheads or labels that decorate the connection. The placement of each type of 
decoration can vary, so a
<a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/draw2d/DelegatingLayout.html"><code>DelegatingLayout</code></a>
is used to delegate to each 
child's constraint object, a <a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/draw2d/Locator.html"><code>Locator</code></a>. 
PolygonDecoration can be used to create render a rotatable shape at the end of a 
connection. The end of a connection can be labeled by adding a Label with a 
<code>ConnectionEndpointLocator</code>. A connection will extend its bounds beyond what would 
be required to paint just the polyline.</p>

<h3>Connection Layout</h3>
<p>Connections extend the process of validation and layout to include routing. 
Since layout is the process of positioning children, routing must come first. This 
allows 
a child's locator to operate on the connection's 
newly-routed points.</p>
<p>During the validation step, the connection must remember its old 
bounds and determine its new. It then must damage the appropriate regions on the 
update manager. The provided implementation does all of these things for you. It 
also requests revalidation according to certain events specific to connections, 
such as an anchor moving or the router changing.</p>
