<h1>Draw2d Overview</h1>
<p>
<img src="images/system.gif" align="right"/>Draw2d is a lightweight toolkit of 
graphical components called <b><i>figures</i></b>. Lightweight means that a 
figure is simply a java object, with no corresponding resource in the operating 
system. Figures can be composed via a parent-child relationship. Every figure 
has a rectangular <b><i>bounds</i></b> inside which it, and its children, paint. 
A layout manager can be used to place children based on their index and/or 
constraint.</p>
<p>
A <code>LightweightSystem</code> associates a figure composition with an SWT 
Canvas. The lightweight system hooks listeners for most SWT events, and forwards 
most of them to an <code>EventDispatcher</code>, which translates them into 
events on the appropriate figure.</p>
<p>
Paint events, however, are forwarded to the <code>UpdateManager</code>, which 
coordinates painting and layout. Figures can be updated in ways which affect 
their appearance or size, and the update manager ensures that only one layout 
occurs, followed by a repaint of only the region which was updated.</p>
<p>
Any type of diagram, document, or drawing can be easily constructed and 
efficiently updated by combining the provided figure and layout implementations 
along with the use of custom figures or layouts when needed.</p>
