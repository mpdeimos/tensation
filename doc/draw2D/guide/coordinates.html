<h1>Coordinate Systems</h1>
<p>Draw2d provides a flexible coordinate with simple defaults. Different 
coordinate systems are required by certain optimizations and features provided 
by draw2d. A coordinate system is nothing more than an adjustment made to the 
Draw2d <code>Graphics</code> when painting children (coordinate systems have <b>
no affect</b> on the way a figure paints itself). For example, it is possible to 
translate or zoom a Graphics. Both of these operations affect subsequent paint 
calls. To match what you see, operations like searching for a figure at a point 
must respect such coordinate changes.</p>
<p>The default coordinate system is very simple, it is the same for every 
figure. So it doesn't matter if a figure is parented by another figure, you 
could compare the bounding boxes directly to each other. When the figures paint, 
they all paint in the same coordinates, and when hit testing is performed, the 
location is not modified when searching recursively through the children. This 
coordinate system is called <i>absolute</i>. If a figure uses absolute 
coordinates, when it moves, it must also translate its children by the same 
amount. &quot;Absolute&quot; may not be the best choice of words. &quot;Inherited&quot; is probably 
more accurate, since children are inheriting the parent's coordinate system, 
which could be anything.</p>
<p>The opposite of absolute (or inherited) coordinates is <i>relative</i> (also
<i>local)</i>. In a relative coordinate system, the bounds of children are 
relative to the client area of their parent. The client area is the parent's 
bounds unless the parent has insets. When a figure with relative coordinates is 
moved, the children come along for free, without any changes to their bounds.</p>
<h3>Relative vs. Absolute</h3>
<p>The default coordinate system is absolute and is often left unchanged. A 
figure can easily change the coordinate system used for its children by 
overriding useLocalCoordinates(). The following table shows some possible 
reasons to choose either.</p>
<table border="1" id="table1" width="100%">
	<tr>
		<td bgcolor="#00FFFF"><b>Task</b></td>
		<td width="35%" bgcolor="#00FFFF"><b>Absolute Coordinates</b></td>
		<td width="35%" bgcolor="#00FFFF"><b>Relative Coordinates</b></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Translate/move a figure</td>
		<td>The figure and all of its children must be translated, which can be 
		expensive in extreme cases.</td>
		<td>Only the figure's bounds must be updated. The children move for 
		free.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<p>Hit-test / determine repaint regions</td>
		<td>No adjustments are needed to coordinates.</td>
		<td>Some simple math is used to adjust coordinates and rectangles 
		to/from the coordinate system's origin.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Observe the figure's &quot;location&quot; on the Canvas</td>
		<td>A FigureListener can be used if the entire parent chain is using 
		absolute coordinates. But this guarantee is rare.</td>
		<td>A FigureListener and CoordinateListener must be used. You must call 
		translateToAsbolute on the figure being observed to get its canvas 
		coordinates.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Determine the bounds of a parent based on the bounds of the children</td>
		<td>
		<p>Easy - after the children have been position, the parent can then 
		figure out what its bounds should be.</td>
		<td>Extremely hard, since updating the parent's bounds will cause the 
		children to &quot;move&quot;.</td>
	</tr>

<h3>Other Coordinate Systems</h3>
<p>Zooming and scrolling are done specially by the viewport and scalable layered 
pane figures provided with Draw2d. Scrolling a drawing is quite common, and it 
would be silly if doing this required updating the bounding rectangle of every 
figure in the drawing. As an optimization, a viewport can be constructed with <i>
virtual</i> scrolling, which is implemented by translating the coordinate 
system's origin.</p>
<p>Zoom is done by scaling the coordinate system about the origin.</p>
<h3>Working with Absolute Coordinates</h3>
<p>The only types of locations which can be passed around and compared in a 
meaningful way are absolute. Here, &quot;absolute&quot; means the top-most parent (or 
root) figure's coordinate system. When Draw2d is used with SWT Canvas, an 
absolute location is the location on that Canvas. To get the location on the 
Display (i.e. the monitor), you would then have to use the utilities on SWT's 
Display to convert from a Control to the Display.</p>
<p>To convert to and from absolute coordinates, utility methods are defined on 
IFigure. These methods will convert any object implementing the <code>
Translatable</code> 
interface (historical note: zoom was not in the first draw2d release so 
translation was the only type of converting necessary).</p>
<ul>
	<li>IFigure#translateToAbsolute(Translatable) - converts from the receiver's 
	coordinates to absolute coordinates. Note that the receiver's coordinate 
	system is the system in which the receiver is placed, and <b>not</b> the 
	coordinates in which it places its children.</li>
	<li>IFigure#translateToRelative(Translatable) - converts from absolute 
	coordinates to the receiver's coordinates.</li>
</ul>
<p>The above methods are implemented recursively by walking up the parent chain 
and performing the conversion for each parent. It's not easy to extend the 
behavior of a recursive method, so the actual conversions are factored out into 
separate methods.&nbsp; These methods are also public and are called in some 
situations.</p>
<ul>
	<li>IFigure#translateToParent(Translatable) - converts from the coordinate 
	system defined by the receiver.&nbsp; If the receiver uses 
	absolute/inherited coordinates, no conversion is performed.</li>
	<li>IFigure#translateFromParent(Translatable) - converts to the coordinate 
	system defined by the receiver.</li>
</ul>

	<h4>Example: How to place a Shell on top of a Figure</h4>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Given a figure that is displayed on a Canvas, how do we popup a shell 
		such that it is in exactly the same location on the screen?</p>
	</blockquote>
	<h4>Solution:</h4>
	<blockquote>
		<p>First, take the figure's location and convert it to the canvas. Note 
		that the figure's bounds are returned by reference, so you need to 
		create a copy to avoid modifying the original bounds. Next, create an 
		SWT Rectangle and convert it to the display's coordinates:</p>
		<pre>public void example1(Shell shell, Figure figure, Canvas canvas) {
    org.eclipse.draw2d.geometry.Rectangle r;
    org.eclipse.swt.graphics.Rectangle swtRect;

    r = figure.getBounds().getCopy();
    figure.translateToAbsolute(r);

    swtRect = new org.eclipse.swt.graphics.Rectangle(r.x, r.y, r.width, r.height);
    shell.setBounds(canvas.getDisplay().map(canvas, null, swtRect));
}</pre></blockquote><h4>Example: How to Position a Connection using an Anchor</h4>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Given a ConnectionAnchor, what is the proper way to set the endpoint 
		of a connection?</p>
	</blockquote>
	<h4>Solution:</h4>
	<blockquote>
		<p>A connection anchor is a helper object that returns a Point in 
		absolute coordinates. The connection figure can be inside a figure such 
		as a viewport or layer that has its own coordinate system. The following 
		code makes the necessary conversion:</p>

<pre>public void example2(Connection connection,
        ConnectionAnchor sourceAnchor, Point reference)
{
    Point anchorpoint = sourceAnchor.getLocation(reference);
    connection.translateToRelative(anchorpoint);

    PointList list = connection.getPoints();
    list.setPoint(anchorpoint, 0);
    connection.setPoints(list);
}</pre>
